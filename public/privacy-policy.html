            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: May 31, 2025</p>

            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the Application.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

            <h2>1. COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>
            <p><strong>a. Personal Data:</strong></p>
            <p>When you register an account with us, we collect personally identifiable information, such as your email address and password (which is stored in a hashed format by our backend service provider, Supabase). This information is used to create and manage your user account, allow you to log in, and enable you to delete your account.</p>
            <p><strong>b. Translation Data:</strong></p>
            <p>When you use the translation feature of the Application, the words or phrases you submit for translation ("Translation Data") are processed to provide you with the translation service. We do not store your Translation Data permanently linked to your personal account after the translation is provided. The data is processed solely for the purpose of delivering the translation.</p>
            <p><strong>c. Derivative Data (Collected Automatically):</strong></p>
            <p>Our servers, including those managed by our backend service provider (Supabase), may automatically collect standard log information when you access the Application, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Application. This data is primarily used for maintaining the security and operation of our Application, and for internal analytics and reporting purposes, but is generally not linked to your personal account information unless necessary for security or troubleshooting.</p>

            <h2>2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Application to:</p>
            <p>Create and manage your account.</p>
            <p>Enable user-to-user communications (if applicable in the future, currently for account-related comms).</p>
            <p>Provide the translation services you request.</p>
            <p>Allow you to delete your account and associated personal data.</p>
            <p>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the Application.</p>
            <p>Notify you of updates to the Application.</p>
            <p>Respond to your requests and provide customer support.</p>
            <p>Ensure the security and integrity of our Application.</p>
            <p>Comply with legal obligations.</p>

            <h2>3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations:</p>
            <p><strong>a. By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong></p>
            <p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>
            <p><strong>b. Service Providers:</strong></p>
            <p>We may share your information with third-party service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf. Specifically, we use Supabase (Supabase Inc.) as our backend platform provider. Supabase provides us with database hosting, authentication services, and other backend functionalities necessary for the operation of the Application. The data we collect, including your Personal Data (email, hashed password), is stored and processed on Supabase's servers. Supabase is contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the services they provide to us. You can review Supabase's Privacy Policy <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">here</a></p>
            <p>We may also use other third-party service providers for functions such as email delivery or customer service, and your information may be shared with them only to the extent necessary for them to perform these services. These service providers are also contractually obligated to protect your data.</p>
            <p><strong>c. Business Transfers:</strong></p>
            <p>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. In such cases, your information stored with our service providers, including Supabase, may also be transferred.</p>

            <h2>4. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. We rely on the security measures provided by our backend service provider, Supabase, for the protection of data stored on their platform, which includes industry-standard security practices. Passwords you provide are stored in a hashed format. While we and our service providers have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.</p>

            <h2>5. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION</h2>
            <p>We will retain your personal information (email address and hashed password stored on Supabase) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You have the right to delete your account at any time through the Application's settings. Upon account deletion, we will initiate the process to delete your Personal Data (email address and hashed password) from our active databases managed by Supabase. Supabase may have its own data retention policies for backups or logs, which are governed by their terms. Please note that some information may remain in archives or backup systems for a limited period as required by law or for legitimate business purposes before being completely erased. Anonymized or aggregated data, which cannot identify you, may be retained indefinitely.</p>
