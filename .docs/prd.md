# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Arabic Words

## 1. Product overview

The Arabic Words is a mobile application designed to enable seamless bidirectional translation between English and Lebanese Arabic or other Levantine dialets. It caters primarily to expats in Levantine countries, with an initial focus on Lebanese users. The app leverages a pre-verified dictionary stored in a secure database and employs caching mechanisms to ensure rapid search responses. Additionally, a paid feature will allow users to download the dictionary for offline access in future iterations.

## 2. User problem

Expats and residents in Levantine countries, particularly expats living in Lebanon, face challenges with existing translation apps because they only support Standard Arabic. This creates a communication barrier and can lead to misunderstandings in day-to-day interactions. Users need a translation tool that accurately reflects the nuances of the Lebanese dialect, offers quick search functionality, and, in the future, provides offline support through a secure payment process.

## 3. Functional requirements

1. Bidirectional Translation: The app must allow users to enter words in English and receive Lebanese Arabic translations, and vice versa.
2. Pre-verified Dictionary: The translation data should be stored in a secure database with verified entries for accuracy.
3. Caching Mechanism: Implement caching to optimize search speed and provide a smooth user experience, with response times ideally under one second.
4. Payment Integration: Integrate a secure payment gateway that unlocks the option to download the dictionary for offline usage.
5. Secure Authentication: Provide user authentication and authorization for accessing paid features and sensitive data.
6. Future Scalability: Design the database to store multiple dialects, allowing for the expansion of translation capabilities beyond Lebanese Arabic.
